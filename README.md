# Twitter Bot
Twitter is one of the most widely used social networks. For many organizations and people, having a great Twitter presence is a key factor to keeping their audience engaged.

Part of having a great Twitter presence involves keeping your account active with new tweets and retweets, following interesting accounts, and quickly replying to your followersâ€™ messages. You can do all this work manually, but that can take a lot of time. Instead, you can rely on a Twitter Bot, a program that automates all or part of your Twitter activity.
